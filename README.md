# esp-garden
My own little garden of various esp stuff.

Everything is build for the ESP-WROVER-KIT V4.1 from Espressif. The code is written to support higher functions on top of the standard libraries. In planning, no code is written yet. In the testing stage, code is there and runs. In the stable stage the code is tested and runs without any errors. Once there are no functionality gaps left and no modifications are planned, the code reaches complete.
